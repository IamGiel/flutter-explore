# What Spider

A new Flutter project.  Ever seen a spider wander about and dont know what it is?  Is it venomous? Is it beneficial to have around? Were you bitten by one?  NOt sure what to do?

Well, heres the app that will tell you.

Take snapshot of it (a good image please), and googles `Tensorflow lite` will do its NNC work.  Will tell you what that spider is all about.

Good luck.
